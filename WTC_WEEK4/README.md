This past two weeks have been really challengingon my side especiaaly the loops are so challenging i don't want to lie. I don't have much to say this cause wow Lopps showed me flames i don't want to lie. The problem set 2 that I found it difficult was the Vanity Plate yoh thank God i manage to solve it. I know I am still a Beginner but I know I will not give up until I understand every topic.

Thank You for the OpportunutyðŸ˜Š.

CS50 week 0

The CS50 Introduction to programming with python is a nice course for beginners like us. You can understand topic easly. I enjoyed this week video lecture. At first I couldn't understand what is a function, what does it do and how to code it but know I how to code and call it. This week I struggle with Github on how to commit your changes but I will get better as time goes on. Another struggle I faced was when they wanted me to code einstein formula that was hard to code truly speaking but beside that I did good for This week. I am eager to start Next week work hoping it won't be hardðŸ™‚.

This Week i have learnt Function and variableðŸ™‚.
